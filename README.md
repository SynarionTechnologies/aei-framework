## üöÄ Project Goals

- **Create a solid and flexible foundation** for developing *Autonomous Conscious Units* (ACU).
- **Enable modular neural network architectures**‚Äîhot-swappable, upgradable, and persistent.
- **Support knowledge modules** that can be attached/detached and upgraded as needed.
- **Promote large-scale multi-agent interactions** and true evolutive intelligence.
